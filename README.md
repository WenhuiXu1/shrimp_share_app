## ðŸ’» [Click here](https://shrimp-share-app.onrender.com/) to see my live project.


This is a CRUD app that is created to preserve the good memories of my time during GA bootcamp. Our cohort group name is "Special K's Shrimp Shack', so I named this app Shrimp Share, which allows our classmates up upload fun memes or pictures to record our time during the 3-month learning together. 

Some features of the app:
- A RESTful app that performs CRUD operations
- Using semantically HTML and CSS
- Using wireframs and ER diagrams as planning tools
